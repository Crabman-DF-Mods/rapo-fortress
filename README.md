# Rapo Fortress - v1.0.1 [47.05]

_NOT AN OFFICIAL DRAWN TO LIFE PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH THQ, AGATSUMA, OR 505 GAMES._

This mod for [Dwarf Fortress][Dwarf_Fortress] adds unique creatures, civilizations, plants, and materials from [Drawn to Life][DTL], and its 2 sequels with the same name, "Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter", on the [DS][DS] and [Wii][Wii] (bearing in mind that the Wii version is not canon apparently), as well as [Drawn to Life: Two Realms][2R].

This mod was created with the help of the [Dwarf Fortress RAW language server extension][LS], which is currently in beta, but I still recommend it for anyone wanting to make Dwarf Fortress mods, either for the first time or as a veteran.

## Installation

Copy-paste all files this mod's `/objects` folder into the `/raw/objects/` folder from Dwarf Fortress.

## Content

__Raposa:__ civilized creatures that greatly resemble humans, but whose bodies are covered in fur everywhere except their faces, and who possess long upright ears.

- __Village Raposa:__ a raposa civilization type based off the original raposa village from the first game; similar to humans "plains" civilizations, but with more mellow/peaceful ethics and a worship of art and creation.

- __Mine Raposa:__ a playable raposa civilization type based off "Lavasteam" from the DS sequel. Like the village rapo civ, but based off dwarves instead of humans (and slightly more ethically dubious than village raposa). Very much into mining, wealth, and magma; they'd feel right at home with the dwarves on that front.

__Ice Dragons:__ it's Frostwind! Flying, limbless blue dragons that breathe out sharp icicles. They are semi-megabeasts associated with wind, weather, and chaos.

__Banya:__ a crop similar to wheat, though right now it has no special connection to raposa civs, it's just another crop in the world.

__Banya Crystals:__ semi-opaque and blue crystals that grow in clusters, they are quite valuable, and... Edible?

## Planned Content
