[i]NOT AN OFFICIAL DRAWN TO LIFE PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH THQ, AGATSUMA, OR 505 GAMES.[/i]

This mod adds unique creatures, civilizations, plants, and materials from [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawn_to_Life]Drawn to Life][/url], and its 2 sequels with the same name, "Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter", on the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawn_to_Life:_The_Next_Chapter_(Nintendo_DS_video_game)]DS[/url] and [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawn_to_Life:_The_Next_Chapter_(Wii_video_game))]Wii[/url], as well as [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1378070/Drawn_to_Life_Two_Realms/]Drawn to Life: Two Realms[/url].

[b]Includes graphics![/b] I'm no artist, so they're not very good (just terrible edited versions of the vanilla graphics), but they exist! It beats having the debug placeholder art anyway.

This mod was created with the help of the [url=https://gitlab.com/df-modding-tools/df-raw-language-server]Dwarf Fortress RAW language server extension[/url], which I highly recommend to anyone wanting to make Dwarf Fortress mods, either for the first time or as a veteran.

This mod is available for download from [url=https://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=16153]DFFD[/url], through without graphics.
